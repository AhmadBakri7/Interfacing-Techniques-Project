This Arduino code controls a two-wheeled robot with ultrasonic and infrared sensors. The robot moves forward, adjusting motor speeds based on encoder counts for straight motion. It turns right or left upon detecting obstacles on the right or left, respectively. The code combines precise encoder-based control with sensor feedback for effective obstacle avoidance.
